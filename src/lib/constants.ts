  { name: "Miss AmericanPie", title: "1979 Ford F250 - C6 Transmission Rebuild", text: "We took a C6 to Juvenal to be rebuilt for our '79 Ford F250. The transmission was installed on time and they even sourced a hard-to-find part. It came out flawless. Juvenal told us to bring the truck when they installed the transmission for a full inspection. Once installed, we brought it in and they had it running perfectly in less than an hour. They even installed a grommet on the linkage we had so much trouble with right away! Customer service and attention to detail are top-notch, even on classics! Definitely a customer for life. THANK YOU AGAIN!", rating: 5, image: "/review1.jpg" },

Lonestar immediately sent a truck to pick it up and rebuilt my transmission in 4 business days for a fair price. The truck shifts smoother than ever. They took me back to the shop and showed me everything they were doing to the truck; they kept me informed every step of the way. Definitely a satisfied customer.
